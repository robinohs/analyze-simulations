# FLoRaSat CLI
  
  This is a holding repository for the development of a CLI for [FLoRaSat](https://gitlab.inria.fr/jfraire/florasat).
  The purpose is to provide an easy way to:
  - install the framework (TODO)
  - run simulations (TODO)
  - extract statistics (DONE)
  - create plots to showcase the results (DONE)

Because of the inability of the python CLI and language to process huge route data stored by FLoRaSat, ***florasat_statistics*** provides a Rust library which can be used within python.

You can install ***florasat_statistics*** with pip as follows:

    pip install florasat-statistics

The CLI can be downloaded from Github.
